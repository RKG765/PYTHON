# condictions are like 
# playing pubg on sunday this is condition playing only on sunday
# so,In python we use if else or elif as conditions
# last else is used when all the if,elif is failed
a = 3
# 1.if,elif,else ladder
if(a>2):
    print("The value of a is greater than 2")
elif(a<6):
    print("the value of a is less than 6") # inthis ladder you can put unlimited number of elif
elif(a>4):
    print("the value of a is greater than 4")
else:
    print("the value of a is niether difined")
# single if statement
if(a>2):
    print("the value of a is greater than 2")

if(a<12):
    print("the value of a is less than 12")

if(a>12):
    print("the value of a is greter than 12")
