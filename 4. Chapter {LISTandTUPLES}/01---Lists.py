# python lists are containers to store a set of values of any data type
# lists are created using []
# you can also change the number inside of bracket like in line 10
# like as follows
a = [12,23,321,33,34,32,1,3234,334,34355,66,64]
print(a)
# as you see the all contents in a is printed as same as in the bracket
# print(a[3])
# print(a[11])
# changing the value within the list[] like a[0] = 54
a[3] = 67
print(a)
# access using index like a[0],a[1], etc.
# We can create a list of differrent types
c = [123,"raj",True,65.43]
print(c)
# raj = c.remove("raj")
# print(c)
# list slicing
friends = ["Raj", "arjun", "raju", "raja", "sid" ,54]
print(friends[0:4])
print(friends[2:5])
print(friends[-3:])
